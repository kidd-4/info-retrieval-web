If he shut it off, he would hear more complaints about his apparent lack of judgment.</p>\n\n\t<p>Xiao-Ming\u2014a pseudonym\u2014says this was part of a problematic two-month homestay situation last semester. He moved to Montreal from Beijing to pursue graduate studies in computer software programming at Concordia University.</p>\n\n\t<p>The international student will be filing a violation this week to Quebec\u2019s Human Rights Commission for discrimination based on ethnic origin and language, with the help of the Centre for Research-Action on Race Relations. </p>\n\n\t<p>\u201cWe want to see if we can hopefully create a precedent for international students in homestay situations,\u201d said Fo Niemi, CRARR\u2019s executive director. </p>\n\n\t<p>Deciding whether to leave the light on or off was only one of Xiao-Ming\u2019s worries. From Sept. 6 to Nov. 1, he lived in a duplex located at 1215 Gohier St., only a few blocks away from the Cote-Vertu metro in Ville Saint-Laurent.</p>\n\n\t<p>Xiao-Ming had an eight-month lease with his landlord, Ju Ming Eh, who signed his name on the document as \u201cJupiter.\u201d The duplex has three bedrooms on two floors. Ming Eh lives there with his wife, Grace Hsieh, and their children. They moved to Canada from Taiwan almost two years ago. </p>\n\n\t<p>The homestay lease stipulated that Xiao-Ming would be fed three meals per day and \u201cothers as attached.\u201d No utilities were included within his $850 monthly rent. To use basic necessities such as heating or hot water, he would have to pay an additional $20 per month. </p>\n\n\t<p>When the temperature started dropping in October, Xiao-Ming says his landlord never responded positively to requests to raise the heat. </p>\n\n\t<p>\u201c\u2018In my home, winter begins in December,\u2019\u201d Xiao-Ming remembers his landlord saying.</p>\n\n\t<p>To gain access to a list of basic items like a clothes dryer, printer, microwave, toothpaste, or even dessert, the landlord set an additional monthly cost of up to $200. Xiao-Ming says he never paid more than the $20 fee associated with heating and hot water. He didn\u2019t see the list of extra costs until after the lease was signed.</p>\n\n\t\n\t\t<div class="figure alignleft">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<a class="cb" href="https://thelinknewspaper.ca/images/articles/Volume_36/News/_resized/25CA.avgrent.carlbindman.png" rel="images" title="Source CBC. Graphic Carl Bindman"><img alt="" src="/images/articles/Volume_36/News/_resized/25CA.avgrent.carlbindman.png"/></a>\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class="caption">Source CBC. Graphic Carl Bindman</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\n\t<p>The food, Xiao-Ming says, also made his stomach sick. His meals every day consisted mainly of carrots, potatoes and rice, with the occasional meat portion. The student from Beijing says the students living there often ate leftovers.</p>\n\n\t<p>Like the concerns about heat, the complaints over the food were ignored, Xiao-Ming says. So, on Nov. 1, he left.</p>\n\n\t<p>On Dec. 8, he received a legal notice from his former landlords, who demanded two months worth of rent.</p>\n\n\t<p>Hsieh and Ming Eh offer three rooms for students. According to the R\xe9gie du Logement, homestays with up to two bedrooms are considered personal situations and do not require a lease. With three rooms or more, tenants and landlords are required to sign a lease. Upon arriving in September, Xiao-Ming was given a month to decide whether to stay or find a new place to live. At the beginning of October, he signed a lease, which was supposed to end in July. Hsieh says Xiao-Ming broke his lease in November without notice, and the room was left empty for two months.</p>\n\n\t<p>Xiao-Ming says the landlord threatened to use his passport and study permit against him to ensure that he wouldn\u2019t find another place to live. He says he has \u201cno idea\u201d how they got his documents, but Hsieh says she asked for them before making a copy. </p>\n\n\t<p>According to the Commission d\u2019acc\xe8s \xe0 l\u2019information, landlords can ask to see official documents, but do not have the right to collect the information or photocopy them.</p>\n\n\t<p>At least four students, including Xiao-Ming, have left the homestay since last October.</p>\n\n\t<p>The international student found the duplex in Montreal through Bright International Student Services Inc., an agency based in B.C. He signed a contract in China with <span class="caps">BISSI</span>, who he found through a Chinese organization. The firm, New Oriental Education and Technology Group, provides international study consultation and private education services.</p>\n\n\t<p>Xiao-Ming says he paid New Oriental $5,000 for beginner English lessons and to help with his application to Concordia, as well as paying <span class="caps">BISSI</span> $1,830 to help him locate a homestay.</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<blockquote class="pullquote">\n\t\t\t<p>\u201cStudents will choose to stay with a family, because they think that means they\u2019re going to be taken care of well.\u201d <em>\u2014Leanne Ashworth, Concordia Student Union Housing and Job Bank</em></p>\n\t\t</blockquote>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p><span class="caps">BISSI</span> kept $830 in fees, for services like airport pick up, plane ticket booking, help setting up medical insurance, filing tax-returns, opening a bank account as well as a cell phone plan and purchasing public transit tickets. </p>\n\n\t<p>Only half of the services were provided, Xiao-Ming says. The rest of the money went towards a rent deposit. When he arrived in Montreal he received $575 back of the $1,000 deposit. The rest of that money went towards first month\u2019s rent.</p>\n\n\t<p>Two media representatives from New Oriental were contacted, but could not be reached by press time. A member from <span class="caps">BISSI</span> said they find homestays through online ads, which is how they found the one in Ville Saint-Laurent. </p>\n\n\t<p><span class="caps">BISSI</span> then send a worker based in Montreal to inspect the house, interview the host family, and check for criminal records before connecting students there. If the student has a satisfactory experience, then they continue to use the homestay, the worker explained over the phone. He said English documents detailing the different packages they offer were confidential, as he declined to give his name before hanging up. </p>\n\n\t<p>Xiao-Ming had the choice between an English or Chinese homestay. He was originally supposed to stay in an English home because he wanted to improve his language skills. Despite the original agreement, he received a call from <span class="caps">BISSI</span> three days before he was expected to arrive in Montreal offering him a spot in a Chinese homestay instead.</p>\n\n\t<p>\u201cI had no time,\u201d he says. \u201cI had to say yes.\u201d</p>\n\n\t\n\t\t<div class="figure alignleft">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<a class="cb" href="https://thelinknewspaper.ca/images/articles/Volume_36/News/_resized/25CA.intlstudents.carlbindman.png" rel="images" title="Source Concordia University.

Graphic Carl Bindman</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\n\t<p><strong>Recruiting internationally</strong></p>\n\n\t<p>Concordia sends a team of three to four people approximately eight times a year to speak with students in China, according to Matthew Stiegemeyer, the university\u2019s director of student recruitment.</p>\n\n\t<p>\u201cWe try to be ready to assist students with any questions they have with interest or vague [awareness] of Canada,\u201d Stiegemeyer explained. </p>\n\n\t<p>Stiegemeyer and his three-person team visit major cities such as Beijing and Shanghai. Some team members are native Mandarin speakers. They arrange to speak at schools, convention halls and even directly with students over coffee, Stiegemeyer said. </p>\n\n\t<p>In 2012, <em>The Link</em> broke a similar story regarding a controversial homestay situation for international Chinese students. The main difference was that an external agent with a Concordia email address arranged the homestay.</p>\n\n\t<p>To his knowledge, the university hasn\u2019t hired a third-party contractor to act as an intermediate in recruiting processes since 2012, but Stiegemeyer wouldn\u2019t rule out \u201cone-off\u201d situations. As for students hiring their own agent or a third-party company\u2014like New Oriental or BISSI\u2014he says they don\u2019t explicitly tell them not to, but if asked, they discourage their usage. </p>\n\n\t<p>Stiegemeyer says they are most interested in the academic programs offered and what it takes to be accepted. One of the requirements is taking an English fluency test. </p>\n\n\t<p>Depending on their test scores, a student may have to take at least one ten-week session of English lessons at the university\u2019s language institute, which costs $3,995. </p>\n\n\t<p>Although Xiao-Ming has been accepted into a graduate studies program for computer software programming, he has yet to take a course in the subject. He first has to complete three levels of English studies, which he expects to finish in June at a total cost of about $12,000.</p>\n\n\t\n\t\t<div class="figure alignright">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<a class="cb" href="https://thelinknewspaper.ca/images/made/images/articles/Volume_36/News/_resized/25CA.homestay(courtesy_xiao-ming)2_685_1050_90.jpg" rel="images" title="The student\u2019s were promised three meals a day at the homestay.

Photo Xiao-Ming</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\n\t<p><strong>How Concordia can help</strong></p>\n\n\t<p>After being accepted into Concordia, international students receive an admissions package that includes a pre-departure guide, outlining what they should do before coming to Montreal. Page 13 of the guide states, \u201cDo not sign a lease for an apartment or commit to any long-term off-campus housing arrangements until you arrive in Montreal.\u201d </p>\n\n\t<p>Students can have an agreement with a landlord before they arrive, but shouldn\u2019t sign a lease before they\u2019ve seen the living arrangements. </p>\n\n\t<p>The university recommends admitted international students book a hotel room for the first few days in the city, according to Kelly Collins, manager of Concordia\u2019s International Students Office. Xiao-Ming signed a contract with <span class="caps">BISSI</span> in China, but he signed the lease with the homestay landlord in Montreal. </p>\n\n\t<p>\u201cStudents will choose to stay with a family, because they think that means they\u2019re going to be taken care of well,\u201d says Leanne Ashworth of the Concordia Student Union Housing and Job Bank. \u201cThey\u2019re willing to pay extra for that because they think they\u2019re going to be safe. I think it\u2019s especially disappointing that that kind of trust is abused.\u201d</p>\n\n\t<p>The <span class="caps">ISO</span> runs webinars from March to April, Collins explains, where students can watch an online presentation and have questions answered live by a representative. In-person orientations are also offered when most students arrive in July and August, she says. The <span class="caps">ISO</span> provides information about tenants\u2019 rights, using pamphlets and documents from <span class="caps">HOJO</span>.</p>\n\n\t<p>The <span class="caps">CSU</span>-run organization offers its information in Mandarin.</p>\n\n\t<p>One of Xiao-Ming\u2019s English teachers referred him to <span class="caps">HOJO</span> after learning of the homestay situation. <span class="caps">HOJO</span> then referred the student to the Concordia Student Union Legal Information Clinic. </p>\n\n\t<p>\u201cConcordia is getting so much money, surely they can allocate more of that money to try and resolve [the housing] problem,\u201d says Walter Tom from the clinic. \u201cWe\u2019re two [CSU] services with a limited budget.\u201d</p>\n\n\t<p><strong>Finding a home in a new city</strong></p>\n\n\t<p>Foreign students can feel restricted from speaking out about housing conditions, because they\u2019re afraid of losing their international student status and being kicked out of the country, says Ashworth.</p>\n\n\t<p>\u201cIt\u2019s very easy for the institution to say, \u2018It\u2019s not our problem.\u2019 But wait a minute, you\u2019re bringing them here to study at Concordia, it is your problem,\u201d Tom says. Housing conditions can have a lot to do with students\u2019 success, he continued. </p>\n\n\t<p>Xiao-Ming left Beijing to pursue graduate studies in Montreal because he wants to work for the video game company, Ubisoft.</p>\n\n\t\n\t\t<div class="figure alignright">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<a class="cb" href="https://thelinknewspaper.ca/images/articles/Volume_36/News/_resized/25CA.list.carlbindman.png" rel="images" title="Source Xiao-Ming.

Graphic Carl Bindman</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\n\t<p>So far, the international student says Montreal has been peaceful and quiet. He doesn\u2019t yet consider himself a real Concordia student to give an opinion on the university, but he expects to start his computer software programming degree in September.</p>\n\n\t<p>In early March, Xiao-Ming moved into a new apartment. He\u2019s been living with a friend since he left the homestay. Xiao-Ming found his new apartment online, and now only pays $460 per month.</p>\n\n\t<h3>Does this story sound familiar?</h3>\n\n\t<p><br/>\n\nIn 2012, <em>The Link</em> published an expos\xe9 on a problematic homestay situation in Montreal, which also involved students from China. There were many similarities to Xiao-Ming\u2019s situation: the use of the agency New Oriental, high monthly rent, poor quality of food, and the need to enroll in Concordia English lessons. The one main difference between the two stories\u2014Concordia\u2019s direct involvement.</p>\n\n\t<p>Instead of using Bright International Student Service Inc.\u2014as Xiao-Ming did\u2014the students were put in touch with Peter Low, who was an official university recruitment agent at the time. For a fee of $2,200, Low would \u201cfast-track\u201d the application process and help sort immigration hurdles, but students would have to live in a homestay for at least two months. Some of this paperwork was exported to Low\u2019s company Orchard Consultant Ltd., which\u2014like BISSI\u2014was located in B.C. Since the incident, the university said it hasn\u2019t used any external recruitment agent or contracted work with Orchard Consultant Ltd.</p>\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t<!-- AddThis Button BEGIN
