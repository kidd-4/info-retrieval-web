bad.\u201d</p></div>\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>That\u2019s how Mei-Ling, an anonymous former student politician, describes working at Concordia\u2019s Arts and Science Federation of Associations, a body that represents over 15,000 students.</p>\n\n\t<p>Now she\u2019s filing a complaint to the Quebec Human Rights Commission for discrimination and harassment.</p>\n\n\t<p>In March 2014, Mei-Ling sat down at one of the communal computers in the <span class="caps">ASFA</span> office for printing. That\u2019s when she noticed the vice-president of social affairs was still logged onto Facebook. And she found conversations about her between him and the president of the association.</p>\n\n\t<p>The conversations included things like: \u201cI\u2019m going to try to fuck her at the first meeting,\u201d and \u201cWell whatever, if she doesn\u2019t suck our dicks: impeached.\u201d</p>\n\n\t<p>This particular conversation happened before the executives had all met. \u201cThey had only seen my photo,\u201d she said. \u201cI was one-dimensional.\u201d</p>\n\n\t<p>At one point, later on in the thread, they referred to her as a \u201cchink slave.\u201d</p>\n\n\t<p>\u201cThe terms were so explicit I didn\u2019t feel human,\u201d Mei-Ling said. \u201cThey described me as a sex object, a bird\u2014I\u2019m not even kidding.\u201d</p>\n\n\t<p>When Mei-Ling found the messages, she went to the Dean of Students. There, she was told that her story was a common one in student associations. Also, the Dean couldn\u2019t help her without a quote from the Office of Rights and Responsibilities.</p>\n\n\t<p>That quote arrived during that same meeting, and it said the conversations were private and Mei-Ling was alone to handle the situation.</p>\n\n\t<p>So she went to the Centre for Gender Advocacy, and the Legal Information Clinic, and eventually was referred to Center for Research-Action on Race Relations (<span class="caps">CRARR</span>), which filed the human rights case.</p>\n\n\t<p>She\u2019s seeking moral and punitive damages. But she\u2019s also demanding mandatory sensitivity training on race and gender for <span class="caps">ASFA</span> execs for the next two years.</p>\n\n\t<p>Mei-Ling says after she found the messages she stopped going to the office in the daytime. She asked her parents to accompany her at night, because she was afraid something would happen to her. But she was determined to complete her projects and her mandate, which ended in May.</p>\n\n\t<p>She says the behaviour extended beyond a Facebook chat.</p>\n\n\t<p>She described <span class="caps">ASFA</span> as a \u201ctoxic, blatantly misogynistic, sexist, racist environment that stifled how student leaders should be creating positive change.\u201d</p>\n\n\t<p>Other <span class="caps">ASFA</span> executives and councillors told <em>The Link</em> they had seen signs of this toxicity, but had no idea it had been so bad. They described <span class="caps">ASFA</span> as a \u201cfraternity,\u201d a \u201cboys club,\u201d full of \u201cbeer-pong culture.\u201d</p>\n\n\t<p>Most sources were also quick to point out that not everyone at <span class="caps">ASFA</span> shares the mindset of these two executives. There\u2019s an expectation for council to act. Quickly.</p>\n\n\t<p>The next <span class="caps">ASFA</span> council meeting is on April 9 at Loyola, but a petition is circulating to have it held downtown instead.</p>\n\n\t<p>\u201cMei-Ling somehow became an outsider in this very clique-y political world that is <span class="caps">ASFA</span>,\u201d said Vithu Namasivayam, president of the Urban Planning Association. Even now, some Member Associations are blaming the current situation on her character.</p>\n\n\t<p>Combatting racism and sexism within the organization should be a priority, he said. \u201cIf there\u2019s a place that we should start, it\u2019s probably here.\u201d</p>\n\n\t<p>One former <span class="caps">ASFA</span> member described student leadership as a \u201chigh,\u201d a popularity contest of who could get laid more.</p>\n\n\t<p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a safe place for women,\u201d one <span class="caps">ASFA</span> representative said. And although she never felt threatened, she did feel disrespected as a woman.</p>\n\n\t<p>\u201cI know [one of the executives involved], and I know that he isn\u2019t sexist or racist,\u201d she said, admitting that this \u201cunsafe\u201d culture is normalized.</p>\n\n\t<p>What is agreed is that the federation and university need to send a clear picture that this is not okay.</p>\n\n\t<p>\u201cThis is not about being politically correct, it\u2019s about complying with the Quebec Charter of Human Rights,\u201d said Fo Niemi of <span class="caps">CRARR</span>, the civil rights organization.</p>\n\n\t<p>Mei-Ling asked that her real name not be used, because she does not want to be targeted for cyber bullying, or have this case follow her in the future. She is also still a student at Concordia.</p>\n\n\t<p>But she says she already felt bullied at <span class="caps">ASFA</span>.</p>\n\n\t<p>\u201cThey made it very, very hard for me to complete things,\u201d she said.</p>\n\n\t<p>At the end of her mandate, Mei-Ling was accused of financial mismanagement because her budgets hadn\u2019t been properly updated.</p>\n\n\t<p>The <span class="caps">ASFA</span> council suggested cutting $500 from her honorarium for a deficit in her portfolio that added up to $91.</p>\n\n\t<p>At the final council meeting, Mei-Ling was called out for: 1) not holding events in the original budgets, 2) going over-budget for events and 3) holding events not included in the budget.</p>\n\n\t<p>She was the only executive to have her finances scrutinized.</p>\n\n\t<p>Mei-Ling had submitted requests for quotes regularly about her spending and kept receiving different numbers.</p>\n\n\t<p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t just making expenses left and right,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought I was on the right track.\u201d</p>\n\n\t<p>When she first heard from the finance committee that her budget was out of order, she says she filled out the forms immediately to fix it. She never heard back from the committee.</p>\n\n\t<p>In the end, council agreed to give executives their full honorarium of $1,500 for the year. But Mei-Ling didn\u2019t receive her bonus\u2014meanwhile, the president received a bonus of $3,000.</p>\n\n\t<p>According to <span class="caps">ASFA</span> bylaws, \u201ceach Executive may also receive a bonus of up to $1,500.00,\u201d as decided by the council.</p>\n\n\t<p>Mei-Ling only received her honorarium two months ago\u2014even though her mandate ended in May.</p>\n\n\t<p>The men involved in the Facebook conversation, and other current <span class="caps">ASFA</span> executives did not respond to <em>The Link\u2019s</em> request for comment.</p>\n\n\t<p>These cases are not exclusive to <span class="caps">ASFA</span>.</p>\n\n\t<p>Jane was a former student representative for the Concordia Student Union and would often work on the computers at the union\u2019s office.</p>\n\n\t<p>After leaving her email open one day, another person at the union found photos of her without clothes on and distributed them around the office.</p>\n\n\t<p>She found out months later. She was horrified. She wanted answers.</p>\n\n\t<p>\u201cI really hoped it wasn\u2019t true,\u201d she said.</p>\n\n\t<p>She confronted the person that had been blamed.  \u201cIt wasn\u2019t me,\u201d he told her. \u201cBut I\u2019m really glad I got to see those pictures.\u201d</p>\n\n\t<p>Eventually, she learned it had been the doing of an executive. But this came after they told her to \u201ccalm down.\u201d</p>\n\n\t<p>After requesting some sort of action from the <span class="caps">CSU</span> and the university, the Office of Rights and Responsibilities finally agreed to hear her case. But by then she felt hopeless and dropped it.</p>\n\n\t<p>\u201cFor every person that comes to lodge a complaint, there are many who will not,\u201d said Ana\xefs Van Vliet from the Centre for Gender Advocacy.</p>\n\n\t<p>They call the current complaint procedure incredibly complicated, with an emphasis on mediation.</p>\n\n\t<p>\u201cWhich can be really tricky if you\u2019re someone who has experienced violence,\u201d said Van Vliet. \u201cThat you\u2019re being asked to meet with the person that has harmed you, to try to come up with some sort of resolution.\u201d</p>\n\n\t<p>If Mei-Ling\u2019s case proves anything, it was the reason why victims don\u2019t report, they said.</p>\n\n\t<p>\u201cSomething that we have to remember is that this is not an isolated case,\u201d Anne-Marie Roy said. \u201cThis is something women face everyday in positions of leadership.\u201d</p>\n\n\t<p>Roy is the president of the University of Ottawa\u2019s undergraduate student association. In February, she was sent screenshots of a Facebook conversation between male students with graphic sexual descriptions about having oral and anal sex with her.</p>\n\n\t<p>Although this isn\u2019t restricted to campus life, Roy says it\u2019s important that, moving forward, universities take sexual violence and sexism seriously.</p>\n\n\t<p>\u201cI think the message that universities send women across Canada is that they\u2019re more concerned with the success of young men than they are with the safety of women on their campuses,\u201d she said.</p>\n\n\t<p>The University of Ottawa doesn\u2019t have a stand-alone sexual assault policy, but has adopted recommendations that include having mandatory courses around sexual violence.</p>\n\n\t<p>Before that, approaches to sexual violence hadn\u2019t been focused on survivors experiences, Roy says. Victims face legal threats if they come forward. \u201cThe legal system empowers perpetrators of sexual violence over those who live it.\u201d</p>\n\n\t<p>Roy\u2019s case included five past and present student leaders in the conversation. She received the screenshots anonymously, and was threatened with a lawsuit after copies of the messages were distributed at a board of administration meeting. Her story spread across the nation.</p>\n\n\t<p>\u201cIf these guys weren\u2019t threatening me legally, I\u2019m not sure reporters would have been as interested in the story.\u201d</p>\n\n\t<p>\u201cThe university has to understand that it\u2019s not a question of damage control. It\u2019s not a question of just Mei-Ling,\u201d said Gabrielle Bouchard, the Centre\u2019s Peer Support and Trans Advocacy Coordinator.</p>\n\n\t<p>\u201cMei-Ling is just one person who was in a good enough space in her life to be able to speak of these things.\u201d</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<blockquote class="pullquote">\n\t\t\t<p>\u201cMei-Ling somehow became an outsider in this very clique-y political world that is <span class="caps">ASFA</span>,\u201d <em>\u2014 Vithu Namasivayam, president of the Urban Planning Association.</em></p>\n\t\t</blockquote>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>II.<br/>\nThis isn\u2019t the first time <span class="caps">ASFA</span> execs have been called out for downplaying harassment. In August, a debate over the necessity of a three-hour consent workshop led to an apology letter written to the Gazette by the president of <span class="caps">ASFA</span>. </p>\n\n\t<p>\u201cWe are working hard to prevent any occurrences of sexual violence at our events, and to educate our peers about the issue,\u201d he wrote.</p>\n\n\t<p><span class="caps">ASFA</span> then partnered up with the Sexual Assault Resource Centre and SextEd, an anonymous mobile sex education service.</p>\n\n\t<p>When asked about implementing mandatory consent workshops in residences, President Alan Shepard told <em>The Link</em> in September that \u201csaying it\u2019s mandatory, in my view, actually can diminish its effectiveness.\u201d</p>\n\n\t<p>McGill residences already run a mandatory three-hour workshop on gender, sexual identity and sexual assault through the Rez Project.</p>\n\n\t<p>\u201cThe worst thing is silence,\u201d said Bouchard. \u201cRight now, we\u2019re in structures that encourage silence.\u201d</p>\n\n\t<p>What is the solution? Bouchard says creating a safer university means having open conversations and mandatory training.</p>\n\n\t<p>\u201cIt\u2019s about providing an environment that is respectful and safe, and safety can be psychological,\u201d said Niemi.</p>\n\n\t<p>The University of Oklahoma recently expelled two students for leading a racist fraternity chant and closed down the fraternity. These actions took two days.</p>\n\n\t<p>But the university is also being criticized for handing out a lighter sentence of a year-long suspension to football star Frank Shannon, who was accused of assaulting a female student.</p>\n\n\t<p>In the winter, explicit and violent posts to a private Facebook group about female dentistry students at Dalhousie became a national issue.</p>\n\n\t<p>Dalhousie University has been criticized for imposing a restorative justice program, when not all the women involved had agreed, and removing information online that could identify the students in the group.</p>\n\n\t<p>The Center for Research-Action on Race Relations wants the university to enforce the student code of conduct and operate with zero tolerance for racism, sexism and homophobia.</p>\n\n\t<p>\u201cI would like to see the president of Concordia come out and say, \u2018No, we shall not tolerate this kind of conduct,\u2019\u201d Niemi said.</p>\n\n\t<p>The Centre for Gender Advocacy has already submitted an open letter to President Shepard, offering to bring back the consent workshops to residences. The workshops were given to students at Grey Nuns in the fall of 2012 for the first and only time.</p>\n\n\t<p>The fact that these things are happening within student associations should not be a reason for the university to step back, according to former <span class="caps">CSU</span> president Melissa Kate Wheeler. </p>\n\n\t<p>\u201cThese assaults are happening largely on campus and Concordia has to take responsibility for that,\u201d she said.</p>\n\n\t<p>Wheeler is among others demanding harsher punishments and a hard stance against racial and gender violence and discrimination.</p>\n\n\t<p>\u201cThis is an epidemic on a lot of campuses, and Concordia is no exception,\u201d she said. Many students come from out of town and Concordia becomes the only place they think to turn to, she added.</p>\n\n\t<p>\u201cThe creation of the Sexual Assault Resource Centre was a very good first step, but in its current state it\u2019s nowhere near enough.\u201d</p>\n\n\t<p>The day after Mei-Ling\u2019s story was published in the Gazette, a Facebook page called \u201cNot Safe at Concordia\u201d was created. On Monday it had over 680 likes. Wheeler is encouraging victims of assault and harassment to share their stories confidentially through the page or with mystory@genderadvocacy.org.</p>\n\n\t<p>Since the Gazette reported on the story, the university has taken an informal stance against misogynistic and racist behaviour.</p>\n\n\t<p>President Shepard has outlined in an open letter that safety is \u201cparamount,\u201d and that the university has reached out to Mei-Ling.</p>\n\n\t<p>In the fall, an investigation by the Toronto Star revealed that only nine out of 102 post-secondary institutions in Canada have a special sexual assault policy\u2014which is supposed to provide clear guidelines when dealing with issues of sexual violence.</p>\n\n\t<p>Since then, Ontario colleges have adopted a policy and the University of Ottawa accepted 11 sexual violence task force recommendations.</p>\n\n\t<p>A review of Concordia\u2019s sexual assault policies was launched in December. Concordia\u2019s current code of rights has no mention of sexual assault.</p>\n\n\t<p>Chris Mota, the university\u2019s spokesperson, said an initial review of a sexual assault policy has since broadened to include sexual harassment.</p>\n\n\t<p>\u201cThey\u2019re also going to look at our processes.
