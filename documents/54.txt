About CUFA






 




The Concordia University Faculty Association (CUFA) is a certified union representing full-time faculty members and professional librarians employed at Concordia.


CUFA is governed by an Executive Committee of 7 members and a representative Council of 30 members.


CUFA’s purpose is to promote the professional and collegial interests of its members. As a union, CUFA’s principal functions are to negotiate and to ensure the application of the Collective Agreement on a day-to-day basis.. We normally negotiate a Collective Agreement every 3 to 5 years. Ensuring that our members’ rights as defined under the Collective Agreement and the law are protected is an on-going activity. We deal with issues involving workload, disciplinary matters, discrimination, harassment, denial of contract renewal, denial of tenure, denial of promotion, and termination. To do this work we can count on the hard work of our grievance officers, our in-house lawyer and our outside counsel.


We hold membership in the Fédération Québécoise des Professeures et Professeurs d’Université (FQPPU) and the Canadian Association of University Teachers (CAUT), which both represent our interests at the provincial, federal, and international levels.  We are also members of the CAUT Defence Fund, which provides material and moral support in the event of a strike.


The CUFA offices are located in HB-109 on the Loyola campus.


We want to hear from you! Come help us shape CUFA’s future.
