ABOUT




Art Matters is a non-profit festival that celebrates and supports the developing talent housed at
Concordia University, with the aim of providing emerging artists with practical skills, tools, and
knowledge.


Art Matters takes place in March. Exhibitions curated by students are spread out over three
weeks, punctuated by our signature parties and events.


Art Matters is a fee-levy organization. That means a fraction of all students' tuition allows the
festival to take place. Art Matters is created by and for undergraduate Concordia University
students.


Art Matters gets people together. We encourage students from different artistic practices to
exchange ideas.


Art Matters supports new ideas. We promote diverse artistic approaches, processes, and
risk-taking.


Art Matters starts a dialogue between students and professionals. We provide galleries and
venues as platforms to promote artwork, as well as hosting speakers and workshops.


Art Matters strives to build an inclusive community. Art Matters encourages accessibility and
diversity.


Art Matters makes it known that Art Matters!
